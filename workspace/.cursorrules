# Cursor Instructions

## Code Style
- All comments must be in English
- All code must use classes (prefer Singleton pattern)
- Singleton classes must NOT use @classmethod - use instance methods instead
- Do NOT use @staticmethod - use instance methods instead (unless explicitly requested)
- Private methods (starting with `_`) must always be placed after public methods
- Private classes (starting with `_`) must always be placed after public classes
- Do not nest more than 2 levels of if statements
- If a function has too much logic, extract it into a private helper class with a descriptive name (e.g., `_WorkflowDiscoveryHelper`, not just `_Helper`) placed below the main class

## File Management
- DO NOT create __init__.py files (unless explicitly requested)
- Ensure code works without __init__.py files (Python 3.3+ supports namespace packages)
- Use absolute imports (e.g., `from src.module import Class` instead of package imports)
- Each workflow/subworkflow has its own services/ directory with service classes
- Service classes should have a `perform` method and helper classes if needed
- services/ directories MUST have __init__.py that imports all services for easy importing in workflows
- Services should only process pure data - they should NOT access resources directly. Workflows should get resources and pass data to services

## Testing
- Do NOT run tests automatically after writing code unless explicitly requested by the user
